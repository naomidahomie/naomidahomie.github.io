    <h2>Professional Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to my Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio. This portfolio represents the culmination
      of my academic work at Southern New Hampshire University and highlights my growth across
      software design, algorithms and data structures, and database-driven full-stack development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through these projects, I demonstrate my ability to analyze existing software, apply
      professional coding standards, improve security and performance, and deliver maintainable,
      scalable solutions.

  <h2>Technical Artifacts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Enhancement One:</strong> JolliBank C++ Application 
      (Software Design & Engineering)
      <p>
        The artifact for the Software Design and Engineering category is my JolliBank C++ banking application. Originally developed as a foundational console program, it simulated basic banking operations such as deposits, withdrawals, and account management.

        I selected this artifact because it demonstrates my ability to apply object-oriented design principles and improve software structure. For the enhancement, I refactored the program to improve modularity, strengthen input validation, and enhance overall maintainability. I reorganized the class structure, clarified method responsibilities, and implemented stronger data protection practices.

        Through this enhancement, I demonstrated growth in designing structured, scalable software rather than simply creating functional code.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Enhancement Two:</strong> Stray Text Adventure Game 
      (Algorithms & Data Structures)
      <p>
        The artifact for the Algorithms and Data Structures category is my Stray Text Adventure Game. The original project implemented basic navigation and item management using simple data structures.

        I selected this artifact because it allowed me to expand algorithmic complexity and improve efficiency. During enhancement, I refined the data structures used to manage rooms and player inventory, improved traversal logic, and strengthened control flow to make gameplay more dynamic and scalable.

        This enhancement reflects my growth in analyzing algorithmic performance and intentionally selecting data structures to support efficiency and organization.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Enhancement Three:</strong> Travlr MEAN Stack Application 
      (Databases & Full Stack)
      <p>
        The artifact for the Databases category is my Travlr MEAN stack application, which integrates MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js to manage travel data. The original application supported CRUD functionality across the full stack.

        I selected this artifact because it demonstrates my ability to design and enhance database-driven systems. For the enhancement, I strengthened backend validation, improved error handling, and optimized database queries to ensure data integrity and performance. I also reinforced communication between the frontend and backend layers.

        This enhancement illustrates my growth in building secure, scalable, and well-integrated full-stack applications.
